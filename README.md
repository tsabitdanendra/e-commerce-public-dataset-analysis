# E-Commerce Data Analysis Dashboard

## Overview
This Python-based project utilizes Streamlit to create an interactive dashboard for analyzing e-commerce data. It provides insights through various tabs and visualizations, enhancing the understanding of e-commerce trends.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
Before starting, make sure you have the following installed:
- Python 3.x: Download from [the official Python website](https://www.python.org/downloads/).
- Pip: Python's package manager, usually installed with Python.

### Installation

1. **Clone or Download the Repository**
   - If you have `git` installed, you can clone the repository using:
     ```
     git clone [repository-url]
     ```
   - Alternatively, download the repository as a ZIP file and extract it.

2. **Install Required Libraries**
   - Open a terminal or command prompt.
   - Navigate to the project directory where `dashboard.py` is located.
   - Install the necessary Python libraries. If a `requirements.txt` file is present, run:
     ```
     pip install -r requirements.txt
     ```
     Otherwise, install the libraries individually:
     ```
     pip install pandas matplotlib seaborn streamlit
     ```

## Running the Dashboard

1. **Start the Streamlit Server**
   - In the terminal, ensure you're in the project directory.
   - Execute the following command:
     ```
     streamlit run dashboard.py
     ```
2. **Access the Dashboard**
   - Streamlit will automatically open the dashboard in your default web browser.
   - If it doesn't open automatically, you'll see a URL in the terminal (e.g., `http://localhost:8501`) which you can access using any web browser.

## Using the Dashboard
- The dashboard provides various tabs for different aspects of e-commerce data analysis.
- Explore each tab to see visualizations and insights about orders, payments, reviews, and more.
